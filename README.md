## Introduction
This is the solution provided as response of the Addison Global Backend Technical Assesement. The solution is formed by 5 Java projects that implement the three tasks of the assesment. The relation between projects and tasks is as follows:
  1. task1 (service interface)
     * task1_token_service
  2. task2 (Service Implementation)
     * task2_common
     * task2_authenticator
     * task2_token_creator
     * task2_token_provider
  3. task3 (REST API)
     * task3_token_rest_service
