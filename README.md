# Back-end Technical Assessment

## Introduction
This is the solution provided as response of the Addison Global Backend Technical Assessment. 

As requested, this document contains relevant information related to technical assumptions/decisions made, as well as instructions for running a solution (when applicable) and tests in a Linux environment.

The document is divided in four sections where the first section provides common information for the whole solution. And the following three sections provide more specific details for each of the implemented tasks.

The solution is formed by 5 Java projects that implement the three tasks of the assessment.

### Solution structure
The relation of projects with the tasks that they implement is as follows

  1. task1 (service interface)
  
	1. task1_token_service
  2. task2 (Service Implementation)
  
	1. task2_common
	2. task2_authenticator
	3. task2_token_creator
	4. task2_token_provider
  3. task3 (REST API)
  
	1. task3_token_rest_service
